## About

This template repository provides an example of a Jekyll blog with Docker Compose. By using docker you can have a consistent environment across computers and you don't have to deal with installing ruby and its dependencies. The Jekyll plugin [Jeykll Admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin) is also present, which allows a CMS (Content Management System) experience similar to Wordpress.
