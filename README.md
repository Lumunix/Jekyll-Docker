# Jekyll & Docker Compose

This project provides an example for building a Jekyll blog/site with Docker Compose. Using Docker you can easily
develop your Jekyll site without installing Ruby and can develop it from computer to computer with a consistent
environment.  This is particularly helpful for Windows users.

## Why Use Docker

Docker containers provide a consistent environment across different computers.  For the non-Ruby developer, it means you don't have to install Ruby on Rails to your system to make your site.  This is a great option for Windows users who don't want to deal with Ruby.  No matter what system you use, with Docker, every time you run your container it is isolated form the rest of your computer.  No extra installs, downloads, or running programs other than Docker and your favorite editor.

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
 You must have Docker and Compose installed to run your Jekyll project in Docker.
